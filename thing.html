        <h1> Honey's Origami Portfolio  </h1>
        <h2>These are some of the origami projects I've made:</h2>
        <p>I made these in my origami studio. The links below have step-by-step instructions so you can make your own.</p>
        <hr> CAMEL <hr>
        <a href = "http://origami.me/camel/" target=”_blank”> <img src = "camel.png"/> </a>
        <ul>
            <li>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.</li>
            <li>In Arabian culture, they are so iconic that there are more than 160 words which mean ‘camel’.</li>
            <li>Ancient Greeks, Romans, and Persians used to ride camels while fighting battles.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr> CHAMELEON <hr>
        <a href = "http://origami.me/chameleon/" target=”_blank”> <img src = "chameleon.png"/> </a>
        <ul>
            <li>The two largest species of chameleon on record, the Oustalet's and the Parson's chameleon can grow to 27 inches</li>
            <li>Contrary to popular belief, chameleons mainly change colour to communicate or regulate body temperature</li>
            <li>Their eyes have an incredible range of motion and can move in completely opposite directions.</li>
        </ul>        
        <hr> TEDDY BEAR <hr>
        <a href = "http://origami.me/teddy-bear/" target=”_blank”> <img src = "teddy.png"/> </a>
        <ul>
            <li>The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a hunting trip.</li>
            <li>Bears can walk on their hind legs, so some Native Americans call them "the beasts that walk like man."</li>
            <li>Bears are one of the most intelligent land animals in North America. </li>
        </ul>

        <a href = "http://origami.me/panda/" target=”_blank”> <img src = "panda.png"/> </a>
        <ul>
            <li>In China, pandas are known as ‘da xiong mao’, which means giant bear cat.</li>
            <li>99% of a Giant Panda’s diet is made up of the bamboo plant.</li>
            <li>They spend up to sixteen hours a day eating to gain enough sustenance.</li>
        </ul>

        <a href = "http://origami.me/pigeon/" target=”_blank”> <img src = "pigeon.png"/> </a>
        <ul>
            <li>Pigeons are very clever. They recognise themselves in mirrors, something few animals can do</li>
            <li>Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time.</li>
            <li>Pigeons can find their way back to their nests from 1300 miles away.</li>
        </ul>         
        <hr> CICADA <hr>
        <a href = "http://origami.me/flying-cicada/" target=”_blank”> <img src = "cicada.png"/> </a>
        <ul>
            <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs.</li>
            <li>cicadas' shells are used in traditional chinese medicine.</li>
